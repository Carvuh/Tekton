# Tekton
## command-line Worldbuilding Wiki Manager
There are days when I'm working on building something that feels of heavy contribution to my world, I just don't have time to go through all the hassle of getting "into the mood" when it comes to worldbuilding.

Always having to open my refrences, load up some images to get the creative juices flowing, open up 10 Word documents & 3 Excel sheets just to edit some stankin' information about the way my Dwarves love to drink their 17 types of mead.

*Well not anymore!*

Introducing, the one, the only... **Tekton**!

What Tekton allows you to do is with a couple simple commands, you can get your ideas straight into an organized wiki, that can be packaged and published online for your liking! I'll compile the files for you, you host them on your server! *Easy as that!*

`GANDALFS-PC\Bilbo:MiddleEarth ~ > AddEntry /world/cities Rohan`

We can generate a new wikipage categorized under a specific heirarchy like so!

`GANDALFS-PC\Bilbo:MiddleEarth Rohan ~ > Apppend "Rohan was a great kingdom of Men, located in the land once known as Calenardhon, situated in the great vale between the Misty Mountains to the north and the White Mountains to the south. The land of Rohan extended from the fords of the river Isen in the west, up to the shores of the river Anduin in the east. The forest of Fangorn lay within the borders of Rohan, and the Elven city of Lorien lay to the north of the river Limlight."`

There, now we we'll have a generated wiki page with this as our first paragraph to our page.
